        # *Slam Dunk* and *Norwegian Wood* Are Similar. If You Think So.
        <SubList>
            ## In case of Murakami...
            - His early works capture the aftermath of the **nation-state system**'s collapse. His later works continue the tradition of pre-modern storytelling (**monogatari**).
            - Understanding him fully requires considering his connection to the **Zenkyōtō generation**.
            ## And in case of Slam Dunk...
            - This manga reflects a positive outlook on individual **passion** and **effort** during a de-ideologized era.
            - It lacks the complex tension or **distancing** from the previous era that Murakami sometimes explores.

        <Similarity />

        <MainList>
            ## If you feel these two works are similar
            - Arrange them at a **slight angle** and **close together** to visually represent their connection.
            - In Pentagram, it's more important to express your feelings spatially than to follow general evaluations.

        # *Beenzino* and *E-sens* Are Different. If I Say So.
        <SubList>
            ## Of course, both Beenzino and E-sens are 
            - rappers who base their work on their **inner authenticity**.

            ## But in Beenzino's case, 
            - He actively **embraces** hip-hop's conventions and makes them his own.
            - He incorporates hip-hop **clichés** like "flexin" into a **personal context** (e.g., "12" album).
            - He maintains a **certain distance** from the listener throughout his career, **delaying** the delivery of messages.

            ## On the other hand, E-sens 
            - He uses **personal symbols** rather than relying on **typical genre vocabulary**.
            - He develops his style by **adopting** the hip-hop traditions he prefers and **discarding** those he finds difficult.
            - He prioritizes **clarity** and aims for a more **direct** message delivery.

        <Difference />

        <MainList>
            ## If you feel they are different,
            - Arrange them at a **wide angle** and **far apart** to show the distance.
            - In Pentagram, it's more important to express your feelings spatially than to follow general evaluations.
